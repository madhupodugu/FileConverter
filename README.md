# FileConverter

Please download the <i>Python FileCoonverter</i> project and run it on PyCharm or any Python IDLE.

This project takes a basic csv data from <i>load-csv.csv</i> file and converts it to either a json or yaml file. 
It first asks the user to enter the files format they want to convert from and then asks the file format they want to convert to. Through user input, the <i>main.py</i> 
converts the files and sends a message back to the user about which file it has stored the result.

Currently the project does these following file conversions:

* csv-to-json
* json-to-csv
* yaml-to-json
* yaml-to-csv
* json-to-yaml
* csv-to-yaml
